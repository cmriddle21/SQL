# For this project, I used Kaggle to downloaded a digital media store data "Chinook".
# I then performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#1. Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Customers only from Brazil

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Invoices of customers who are billing from Brazil.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, 
inv.CustomerId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.InvoiceId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook. employees
WHERE title LIKE 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Finding a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
