# For this project I downloaded data set contains booking information for a city hotel and 
# a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, 
# the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

# I then analyzed trends in the data.


#1. To determine the best time of year to book a room, I calculated the average lead time for each month 
# and then sorted the results in ascending order. The month with the lowest average lead time is the best time of year to book.

SELECT arrival_date_month, AVG(lead_time) AS avg_lead_time
FROM hotel_bookings
WHERE is_canceled = 0
GROUP BY arrival_date_month
ORDER BY avg_lead_time ASC


#2. Determining which market segment has the highest average daily rate (ADR) and the most frequent bookings.

SELECT market_segment, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_bookings, 
       AVG(adr) AS avg_daily_rate 
FROM hotel_bookings 
GROUP BY market_segment 
ORDER BY avg_daily_rate DESC;


#3. Analyzing how the number of special requests (e.g., extra bed, late check-out) impacts cancellation rates and booking lead time.

SELECT total_of_special_requests, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_bookings, 
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(is_canceled) / COUNT(*), 2) AS cancellation_rate, 
       AVG(lead_time) AS avg_lead_time 
FROM hotel_bookings 
GROUP BY total_of_special_requests;


#4. Analyzing how the booking and cancellation rates vary by the time of the week or month, and if there any seasonal trends.

SELECT arrival_date_month, 
       arrival_date_week_number, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_bookings, 
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(is_canceled) / COUNT(*), 2) AS cancellation_rate 
FROM hotel_bookings 
GROUP BY arrival_date_month, arrival_date_week_number 
ORDER BY arrival_date_month, arrival_date_week_number;


#5. Determining which distribution channel (e.g., travel agent, direct booking) has the highest ADR and the lowest cancellation rate.

SELECT distribution_channel, 
       AVG(adr) AS avg_daily_rate, 
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(is_canceled) / COUNT(*), 2) AS cancellation_rate 
FROM hotel_bookings 
GROUP BY distribution_channel 
ORDER BY avg_daily_rate DESC, cancellation_rate ASC;


#6. Analyzing the average lead time (in days) for bookings made by customers from each country.

SELECT country, AVG(lead_time) AS avg_lead_time
FROM hotel_bookings
WHERE is_canceled = 0
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY avg_lead_time DESC;


#7. Determining which market segment has the highest average daily rate (ADR) and the most frequent bookings.

SELECT market_segment, 
       AVG(adr) AS avg_daily_rate, 
       COUNT(*) AS num_bookings
FROM hotel_bookings
WHERE is_canceled = 0
GROUP BY market_segment
ORDER BY avg_daily_rate DESC, num_bookings DESC;


#8. Analyzing how the average daily rates of different room types compare to each other, and how they vary by hotel type.

SELECT 
  hotel, 
  reserved_room_type,
  AVG(adr) AS avg_adr
FROM hotel_bookings
WHERE is_canceled = 0
GROUP BY hotel, reserved_room_type
ORDER BY hotel, avg_adr DESC;


#9. Analyzing the relationship between the number of adults and the number of children in a booking, and 
# how that impacts the booking's ADR and cancellation rate.

SELECT 
  adults, 
  children,
  ROUND(AVG(adr), 2) AS avg_adr,
  SUM(CASE WHEN is_canceled = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_canceled,
  COUNT(*) AS total_bookings,
  ROUND(100 * SUM(CASE WHEN is_canceled = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS cancellation_rate
FROM hotel_bookings
GROUP BY adults, children;

# Analysis Notes and Business Conslusions

# The highest number of bookings are from the top 5 countries (PRT, GBR, FRA, ESP, DEU) in terms of customer origin. 
# This can be used to focus marketing and promotional efforts towards these countries.

# Bookings made directly through the hotel website have the lowest cancellation rate and the highest ADR, 
# suggesting that hotels should focus on increasing direct bookings through their website.

# July and August are the busiest months, with the highest number of bookings and occupancy rates. 
# This can be used to plan staffing and inventory needs for those months.

# The average lead time for bookings is around 100 days, suggesting that customers tend to plan their trips well in advance.

# The most frequently booked room types are A and D, with the highest occupancy rates, while 
# the least frequently booked rooms are G and H. This information can be used to optimize inventory and room assignments.

# The cancellation rate tends to be higher for bookings with more adults and children, suggesting 
# that hotels may need to be more flexible with their cancellation policies for families.

# There is a correlation between the number of booking changes and the cancellation rate, suggesting 
# that hotels may need to be more transparent with their booking policies and provide clear information 
# to customers about any potential fees or penalties for making changes to their bookings.
